This is an explation about the script 
-------------------------------------

-> Expansion in shell refers to the process of interpreting and expanding special characters or symbols into their corresponding values or representations. Shell expansion allows you to perform various operations, such as variable expansion, command substitution, wildcard expansion, and arithmetic expansion.

-> Shell arithmetic allows you to perform mathematical calculations within shell scripts or commands. It enables you to manipulate numerical values, perform arithmetic operations, and store the results in variables. Here are the key aspects of shell arithmetic:

Syntax:

Shell arithmetic is typically performed using the $(( )) syntax.
Within the double parentheses, you can write arithmetic expressions and operations.
Basic Arithmetic Operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Modulo (remainder): %

-> Variables in shell scripting are used to store and manipulate data. They allow you to assign values to named variables and reference those values throughout your script. 

-> Shell initialization files are scripts that are executed when a shell is started or a user logs into a shell session. These files allow you to set up the environment, define aliases, configure shell behavior, and execute commands automatically.

Different shells have different initialization files. Here are some commonly used ones:

Bash (Bourne Again SHell):

Interactive Login: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.profile (in that order)
Interactive Non-login: ~/.bashrc
Zsh (Z SHell):

Interactive Login: ~/.zprofile, ~/.zlogin
Interactive Non-login: ~/.zshrc
Fish (Friendly Interactive SHell):

Interactive Login: ~/.config/fish/config.fish
Interactive Non-login: ~/.config/fish/fish.config (deprecated)
Csh (C SHell) and tcsh:

Interactive Login: ~/.login
Interactive Non-login: ~/.cshrc
These files can contain various configurations and customizations to personalize your shell experience. Some common use cases for initialization files include:

Setting environment variables: You can define environment variables like PATH, EDITOR, or LANG to customize your shell environment.
Defining aliases: Aliases are shortcuts for commands. You can define aliases in the initialization files to create custom command shortcuts.
Configuring shell options: You can set various shell options to control the behavior and appearance of the shell. Examples include enabling history expansion, enabling case-insensitive tab completion, or setting the prompt format.
Running scripts or commands: You can execute scripts or commands automatically upon starting a shell session.
It's important to note that changes made to initialization files typically require restarting the shell or using specific commands to reload the changes. The exact process for reloading or applying changes may vary depending on the shell being used.

By modifying the appropriate shell initialization files, you can tailor your shell environment to suit your preferences and automate repetitive tasks or configurations.

-> The alias command in shell allows you to create custom shortcuts or abbreviations for commands or command sequences. It enables you to define your own command aliases, making it easier to execute frequently used commands or to customize the behavior of existing commands.
